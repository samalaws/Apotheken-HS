Project Name: HS-Apo (short for Heinsberg region Pharmacies)

Technology Stack: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Project Overview:

HS-Apo is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive list of pharmacies in the Heinsberg region. The application presents pharmacy information in a user-friendly card format, displaying essential details such as the pharmacy's name, phone number, address, location coordinates, and operating hours.

Key Features:

Interactive Map: Leveraging the Leaflet library, the application integrates an interactive map that pinpoints the exact locations of all listed pharmacies. Users can easily identify the nearest pharmacy based on their current location.
Admin Panel: A admin pages to add, modify, or remove pharmacy data as needed, ensuring the application's data remains accurate and up-to-date.
Single Page Application (SPA): The application is built as a SPA using JavaScript, providing a seamless user experience without requiring full page reloads.

Project Goals:

The primary objective of the HS-Apo project is to create a dynamic and informative web application that empowers users to quickly find the pharmacy services they require. By implementing a SPA architecture and utilizing JavaScript for frontend development, the project aims to deliver a responsive and efficient user interface.

Core Objectives:

Custom JavaScript Development: Unlike many similar applications that rely on popular frameworks like React or Angular, HS-Apo is built entirely from the ground up using plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This approach offers greater flexibility and customization options.
Leaflet Integration: The integration of the Leaflet library provides a robust mapping solution that enhances the user's ability to visualize pharmacy locations and plan their routes.
