Project Name: HS-Apo (short for Heinsberg Area Pharmacies)
Technologies Used: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Leaflet

Project Overview:
HS-Apo is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive list of pharmacies in the Heinsberg area. The application presents pharmacy information in a user-friendly card format, displaying essential details such as the pharmacy's name, phone number, address, location coordinates, and operating hours.

By leveraging the Leaflet mapping library, HS-Apo enables users to visualize the locations of all listed pharmacies on an interactive map.

Core Objectives:

Single-Page Application (SPA): The primary goal of this project was to implement a SPA using JavaScript. By dynamically updating the page content without full reloads, we aimed to create a more responsive and engaging user experience.
Custom JavaScript Development: To avoid relying on established frameworks like React or Angular, we focused on building the application from scratch using plain JavaScript. This approach allowed for greater customization and a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.
User-Friendly Interface: The application's design emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. The card-based layout and interactive map provide a clear and intuitive way for users to find the information they need.
Key Features:

Pharmacy Directory: A comprehensive list of pharmacies in the Heinsberg area.
Interactive Map: A visual representation of pharmacy locations, powered by the Leaflet mapping library.
Location-Based Search: Enables users to find the nearest pharmacy based on their current location.
Detailed Pharmacy Information: Provides users with essential contact information and operating hours for each pharmacy.
Technical Implementation:

JavaScript: Used for all client-side logic, including data fetching, DOM manipulation, and map interactions.
CSS: Employed to style the application's user interface and create a visually appealing design.
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the web pages.
Leaflet: Used to create the interactive map and display pharmacy locations.
